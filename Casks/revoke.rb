  caveats <<~EOS
    Before uninstalling, choose Give All Links Back and Remove Network Filter in
    Revoke's settings, so every app opens its own links again and the network
    filter, a system extension, is removed as well. From a script:
      /Applications/Revoke.app/Contents/MacOS/Revoke --restore-links
  EOS
